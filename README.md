# KataTDDWithLegacy
Example Kata of TDD with legacy code

Our goal is testing and refactoring legacy code.

For this example, we are a Trip service. Specifically, we are a social network for travellers.

Our Bissness Requirements are:
1. We need to be logged in to see the content.
2. We need to be a friend to see someone else's trips
